# About Waypath

Waypath is designed with precision, usability, and user autonomy in mind.

## Purpose

## Key Principles

- No automatic actions are performed without explicit user input.
- All navigation points are stored locally on your device.
- Optimal point saving occurs when sensor accuracy is below 10 meters.
- Offline navigation remains fully functional.
- Full map rendering features may require internet connectivity.

Users are advised to always follow:

- Local rules and laws
- Safety practices
